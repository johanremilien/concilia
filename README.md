**concilia** will be a software for monitoring the speaking time of participants in a meeting.

It will be able to connect to an **SQL** database to store and retrieve data at each run.

Eventually a **voice signature recognition** module will be integrated in order to operate autonomously.

**PHASE 1** [WIP]
- Manual selection of the person speaking on a single device
- Display and possibility of printing the report at the end of the meeting
- No external database management at this phase
 
 **PHASE 2** [TO BE DEFINED]
